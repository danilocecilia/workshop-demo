The intention of this project was to brush up my CSS skills and to learn about NextJS since it's the first time I am using it.

The idea behind this was based on a tweet from a youtuber @Deved about a new design idea for his youtube channel tutorial, so I thought would be nice to create the HTML version of that myself.

I've decided to create an github action for deploying it automatically on S3 bucket, you can see it live here: https://workshop.danilocecilia.com/

If you have any suggestions on improvements please let me know I will be happy to listen you.
